The markdown documents for this project such as README.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, etc (not an exhaustive list) have these problems currently:
- Out of date information
- Duplicated information, both in the same document and across different documents

Hence, I would like you to:
- Carefully read through the existing codebase to figure out what information is out of date and update the document contents
- Propose a better way to organise the documents.
    - You need not retain the same files like DEVELOPMENT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc, you can propose to add or remove files
    - You can also change the structure of existing files

Documents in scope:
- All `*.md` files in the top level directory

Documents OUT of scope:
- CLAUDE.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- All files in `working-docs/`
