Can you help me to update the response format for all of the tools of this MCP server (listed below) to remove the hash attribute? 
Since we are no longer using hashes for concurrency control for editing files.

```
get_text_file_contents
create_text_file
append_text_file_contents
delete_text_file_contents
insert_text_file_contents
patch_text_file_contents
```
